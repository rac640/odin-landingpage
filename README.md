# odin-landingpage

Here is my landing page project! Here are some of my notes through the project: 

- First, I made an overall outline of the website: The header, the 4 content sections, and the footer.  

- As the project instruction suggests, I then started working from top to bottom. As I completed one section at a time, I would commit my work with git. 

- One action that helped me a lot was physically drawing out each section. This helped me a lot when it came to figuring out how I would align flex items. 

- Comments (like content-1 start and content-end) also helped me keep organized!
